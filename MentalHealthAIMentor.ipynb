      "It sounds like you're facing some significant challenges right now, and it's important to address them to improve your mental well-being. Here are some insights and suggestions based on your responses:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stress Management\n",
      "- **Current Approach:** You mentioned listening to songs or sleeping when you feel stressed. While these can be temporary coping mechanisms, they may not address the root causes of your stress.\n",
      "- **Suggestions:**\n",
      "  - **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Try incorporating mindfulness exercises or meditation into your daily routine. Apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer can guide you through these practices.\n",
      "  - **Physical Activity:** Besides your athletic training, engage in other physical activities that you enjoy, such as walking, yoga, or swimming. Exercise can help reduce stress.\n",
      "  - **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and manage stress better.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mood and Energy Levels\n",
      "- **Current State:** You feel numb but energized throughout the day.\n",
      "- **Suggestions:**\n",
      "  - **Emotional Awareness:** Try to identify what might be causing you to feel numb. It could be related to stress, lack of fulfillment, or other factors. Reflecting on this can help you address the root cause.\n",
      "  - **Connect with Others:** Even if you don't like talking about your feelings, small interactions with friends or family can help you feel more connected and less numb.\n",
      "  - **Self-Care:** Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling Setbacks\n",
      "- **Current Response:** You lose all your confidence after setbacks.\n",
      "- **Suggestions:**\n",
      "  - **Positive Self-Talk:** Practice positive affirmations to boost your confidence. Remind yourself of past successes and strengths.\n",
      "  - **Learn from Mistakes:** Instead of dwelling on failures, try to learn from them. Analyze what went wrong and how you can improve next time.\n",
      "  - **Support System:** Even if you don't like talking about feelings, having a trusted friend, coach, or mentor who can offer support and advice can be very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Support System\n",
      "- **Current Situation:** You don't feel supported by your team, coaches, or family in terms of mental health.\n",
      "- **Suggestions:**\n",
      "  - **Open Communication:** Try to open up a little more with someone you trust. It could be a friend, family member, or even a professional counselor.\n",
      "  - **Seek Professional Help:** Consider speaking with a sports psychologist or mental health professional who specializes in athletes' mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Worries\n",
      "- **Current Concerns:** You worry about the future a lot.\n",
      "- **Suggestions:**\n",
      "  - **Present Focus:** Try to focus more on the present moment rather than worrying about the future. Mindfulness practices can help with this.\n",
      "  - **Goal Setting:** Break down long-term goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make the future feel less overwhelming.\n",
      "  - **Visualization Techniques:** Visualize yourself achieving your goals and overcoming challenges. This can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mental Exercises and Tips\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Mindfulness Meditation\n",
      "1. **Body Scan:** Lie down or sit comfortably and focus on each part of your body from head to toe, releasing any tension as you go.\n",
      "2. **Breathing Exercises:** Focus on your breath, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Self-Care\n",
      "1. **Healthy Habits:** Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you're feeling overwhelmed or if these suggestions don't seem to be helping enough, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for personalized support.\n"
